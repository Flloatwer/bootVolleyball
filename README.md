# bootVolleyball
a simple one player pong (volleyball) that fits into the boot sector for 8086 with cga (386 real mode as far as ive tested). it uses bios keystrokes so the paddle moves a lot after one keypress so you can move it with single keypresses. theres like 50-100B left of space in the bootsector cause i forgot to remove the clear function which i never used so you could probably add a simple scoring system. the code is like almost unreadable so idk if you can really change much there. the img is ready to boot

minimum requirements:  
RAM: 64K  
GPU: CGA/VGA  
CPU: 8086  
DISK SPACE: 512B
